- use visual hierarchy (emphasize using size or colour the items that you want the user to look at first)
- use whitespace
- keep content minimal and informative
- keep number of sub-pages low and as unambiguous as possible
- F pattern (bold sub-headings on left)
- horizontal layout for registration to prevent scrolling
- follow conventions (can a user find what they're looking for in Japanese-translated babelfish version?)
- have someone -else- test the website for usability early and often
- be careful with colour, consider the colour-blind
- double check different screen sizes, device types (tablet? phone?), browsers, connection speeds, etc.
- keep layout and expectations consistent across pages
- give feedback for any form of interaction (eg make sure a registration or submission gets not only an on-screen acknowledgment, but also a ringback email!)
- provide alt-text and name links meaningfully for blind users (eg text to speech)
- make it navigable using keyboard only

- search bar? only if absolutely necessary (for a website of this size it shouldn't be!)

- include a (separately-designed) printer-friendly info sheet!
